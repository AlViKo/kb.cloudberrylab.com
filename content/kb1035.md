## Problem

CloudBerry Backup VM edition is agent-less solution and designed to work with VMware Virtual Machines. Our VM edition is not that mature, so the main position of this product is decent VM archiving. When you configure backup plan and it returns wrong FQDN even you enter IP. This actually returned by VMware API for Data Protection (VADP) and CloudBerry does not handle this accordingly. When your VMware nodes are not part of the domain they may have wrong host files configured.

## Resolution

This can be resolved by the following workaround (we are set to address this issue in one of the next release), but for now:

1. Go to your <code class="language-bash">C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code>.
2. Add new line with: IP_address of your VMware farm FQDN (for instance <code class="language-json">192.168.1.1 vmware.domain</code>).
3. Might be <code class="language-bash">ipconfig</code> / <code class="language-bash">flushdns</code> required.

Example:


<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="2-5">
<code>
type C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
[... something else ...]
127.0.0.1 fiji.cloud.local
</code>
</pre>

Check if you can <code class="language-json">nslookup</code> your IP and it touches your FQDN, ping it to see if it returns ICMP. Configure your plan.
