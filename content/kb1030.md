CloudBerry Backup for Linux designed to help customers to protect their file system from disaster and keep certain retention policy of files and folders off-site (public cloud, i.e. S3). It is possible to install CloudBerry Lab for Linux even with no UI, but you may face the GL dependencies request which you need to either skip or satisfy.

<pre>
<code class="language-bash command-line" data-host="localhost">
sudo rpm -i rh.rpm
error: Failed dependencies:
        libpcre16.so.0()(64bit) is needed by cloudberry-online-backup.x86_64
</code>
</pre>

### How to skip GL dependencies for Linux CLI installation (CloudBerry Lab).

There is no problem to install them, but you probably don't need them (if they are related to GL => graphic interface of your Linux / Unix). So to save time and install the CBL product do the following:

<pre>
<code class="language-bash command-line" data-host="localhost">
sudo rpm -i rh6.rpm --nodeps
</code>
</pre>


> * <code class="language-bash">nodeps</code> flag just ignores all dependencies (so it is important if you make sure you have them related to graphic interface only!).
> * rh6.rpm - is one of the build for RedHat from [CloudBerry Lab for Linux page](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/download-thanks.aspx?prod=cbbub1214).
