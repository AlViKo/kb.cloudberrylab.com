## Problem
Your cloud storage provider sent you monthly bill and detailed explanation what you were charged for.
And surprisingly you realize that storage contains only 60-70% of the entire bill. The rest of that amount you need to pay for requests.


## Resolution
In order to have a better visibility on what you consume from storage provider's subscription we've made this setting in our backup agent.

* Go to the following folder and locate <code class="language-powershell">enginesettings.list</code> file.
For standalone backup <code class="language-powershell">C:\ProgramData\CloudBerryLab\CloudBerry Backup\enginesettings.list</code>. For Managed backup this will be something different, depending on the name of the product that you made but still it will be in ProgramData folder. Example for the <code class="language-powershell">Company ABC</code> - <code class="language-powershell">C:\ProgramData\Company ABC\enginesettings.list</code>;

* In <code class="language-powershell">enginesettings.list</code> you need to put the following text somewhere in the end:
<code class="language-json">&lt;LogRequestCountersOnExit&gt;true&lt;/LogRequestCountersOnExit&gt;</code>. This setting should work for all backup versions, but starting from Backup 5.4 you should switch to the following setting: <code class="language-json">&lt;LogRequestsOnExit&gt;true&lt;/LogRequestsOnExit&gt;</code>;

* Run your plan;

* Click on Tools &rarr; Diagnostic &rarr; Open in folder;

* Find the latest modified file with <code class="language-json">.log</code> extension (file name is your backup plan ID);

* In the end of the file you will see:
<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="0">
<code>

</pre>

Now you can see how many requests have been sent.
