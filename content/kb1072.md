## Problem

Cloudberry Backup stores the information about uploaded data to the backup destination in local repository (sqlite database). This small database may grow from day to day. It depends on the amount of data that you might have been uploading according to your retention policies or data importance. By default this database is located in the %program% data directory. Where you can find product's configuration files, log files and other. By default it's located on disk C.

But what should you do in case you don't have enough disk space but your local repository consumes several Gigabytes of data?

## Suggestions and Resolutions

1. You can shrink database by going to the Tools -> Options -> Repository -> "Shrink Database" button.
It will remove all empty lines, all information about outdated accounts, history or cache. In some cases you will win several Megabytes. But what if it's not enough.

2. You can move your repository somewhere outside the disk C. To the disk with more free space.

For this you need go to Tools -> Options -> Repository -> Change the location folder

NB:

* The database will be moved (!not copied!) to a new location
* Make sure that your UI is running under administrator
* Make sure that your Backup service is stopped. Otherwise, you will receive an error

Once you run the Cloudberry Backup with certain rights and stopped the backup service, you should receive the following notification that the database location successfully changed

Restart your backup agent, the service and check that you can see all your data under the Backup Storage tab in UI.
