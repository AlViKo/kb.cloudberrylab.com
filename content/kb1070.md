## Problem
1. You created your backup by using Custom backup mode
2. You need to restore the data on another computer:
  * You added an account
  * You set up the backup prefix in the advanced settings
  * Your local repository was synchronized
  * You don't see the needed data under your account

## Resolution
Once you proceed with all steps mentioned above, make the following:

1. Run command prompt under certain rights
2. Navigate to the Cloudberry Backup installation folder
3. Execute the following command:

    *```cbb.exe account -s "your_account_name" -custom "folder_name"```*

Where "your_account_name" is your cloud storage account name and "folder_name" is a name of the folder that you can not see under your bucket/container
