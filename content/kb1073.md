## Problem

During the data upload you may see an error "The specified path, file name, or both are too long" or "The maximum file name limit or path length is exceeded".

## Suggestions and Resolutions

Here you can find the limits for the entire path and file names. For all operating systems that are supported by Cloudberry:

<center>

| Limit for | Windows | Mac/Linux |
|---------- |---------|-----------|
|entire path| 4096 bytes| unlimited |
|file name  | 255 bytes | 255 bytes |

</center>
For some cloud storage providers the entire path and/or file names length might be limited individually.
