## Problem

When creating your backup strategy with Cloudberry Backup sometines you need to analyze backup perfomance

## Suggestions and Resolutions

1. Start MS SQL management studio
2. Create a new script
3. Select the database to run against
4. Instert the following script and execute it




```
SELECT s.database_name, m.physical_device_name, CAST(CAST(s.backup_size / 1000000 AS INT) AS VARCHAR(14)) + ' ' + 'MB' AS bkSize, CAST(DATEDIFF(second, s.backup_start_date, s.backup_finish_date) AS VARCHAR(4)) + ' ' + 'Seconds' TimeTaken, s.backup_start_date,
CAST(s.first_lsn AS VARCHAR(50)) AS first_lsn,
CAST(s.last_lsn AS VARCHAR(50)) AS last_lsn,
CASE s.[type] WHEN 'D' THEN 'Full'
WHEN 'I' THEN 'Differential'
WHEN 'L' THEN 'Transaction Log'
END AS BackupType,
s.server_name, s.recovery_model
FROM msdb.dbo.backupset s
INNER JOIN msdb.dbo.backupmediafamily m ON s.media_set_id = m.media_set_id
WHERE s.database_name = DB_NAME() 
ORDER BY backup_start_date DESC, backup_finish_date
GO
```
