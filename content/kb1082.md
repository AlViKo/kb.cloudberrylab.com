## Suggestions and Resolutions

This error may occur in case of IP address configuration absence, for example in case of machine is in a network without DHCP server.

As a solution, you can configure a static IP address via command prompt:

* Boot from CloudBerry USB, go Tools and select Command Prompt

* Check an IP address with command:

<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="2-3">
<code>
netsh interface ipv4 show config
</code>
</pre>

* Once you'll execute a command, check the name of a network interface you are going to configure (e.g. "Local Area Connection")

* Assign a static IP address with the following command:

<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="2-3">
<code>
netsh interface ipv4 set address name="YOUR INTERFACE NAME" static IP_ADDRESS SUBNET_MASK GATEWAY
</code>
</pre>

* In case of DNS is needed, use the command:

<pre class="language-powershell command-line" data-prompt="C:\" data-output="2-3">
<code>
netsh interface ipv4 set dns name="YOUR INTERFACE NAME" static DNS_SERVER
</code>
</pre>

* Exit command prompt and select "Bare Metal Recovery", it may take some time to launch CloudBerry agent software.
