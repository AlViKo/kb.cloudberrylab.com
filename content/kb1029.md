## Problem

CloudBerry Backup for [Linux][1f46d3be] comes with [command line interface][4ac3b676] (CLI) what allows customer to configure file level backup for Linux content (i.e. files & directories). CLI is very powerful tool operate entire backup ecosystem (i.e. configure account, configure license, create plans, manage plans, - actually all what is possible through regular GUI of CloudBerry Lab for Linux with Graphic interface). [Managed backup][f239e3e0] edition (the one which you obtain from MBS) needs to be linked to certain user first and then - activated. So if you missed the fist step and trying to activate your license you are going to see the following error message:

<pre>
<code class="language-bash command-line" data-host="localhost">
cbb activateLicense -e your.email@domain.com -t
online Backup Command Line Interface started
error: License not verified! product can't backup now
</code>
</pre>

## Resolution

In order to resolve the issue you need to go through the following steps:

*  Link your copy of downloaded product (from MBS) to existing user;
*  Activate either commercial or trial license.

<pre>
<code class="language-bash command-line" data-host="localhost">
cbb addAccount -e your.email@domain.com -p Password -ssl yes|no
</code>
</pre>

This will link your software to appropriate account in MBS. Next step is to activate license.

If you have commercial license (recently purchased or want to reused released license):

<pre>
<code class="language-bash command-line" data-host="localhost">
cbb activateLicense -e your.email@domain.com -k <license_key>
</code>
</pre>

Alternatively you can request 15 days trial using the following syntax:

<pre>
<code class="language-bash command-line" data-host="localhost">
cbb activateLicense -e your.email@domain.com -t
</code>
</pre>
